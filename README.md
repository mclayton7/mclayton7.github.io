Source code for macclayton.com
=========================

This is the [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) source code for my personal website that I host using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Because I need SASS compilation, you'll need to switch to the source branch (if you clone this repo) to do your work, because the Rakefile will compile all the assets to the master branch.
