<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a software engineer working for Lockheed Martin CDL Systems, USA in Huntsville, AL. A few years ago I married the girl of my dreams and we moved here from Georgia where I had interned with WinShape Camps. I studied electrical engineering a Georgia Tech, but was drawn to software engineering because of the seemingly endless creativity programming offered. Now, I have the opportunity to work on control software for UAVs and even fly them.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>During my free time, I like to stay active by playing soccer and watching college football. I also have an old Toyota Land Cruiser that is at the forefront of most of my adventures. Learning to work on a car has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I tinker in Linux and Raspberry Pi's when I have the time.</p>
