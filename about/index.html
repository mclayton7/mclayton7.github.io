<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I recently Graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I'm currently finishing up an internship with <a href="http://www.winshapecamps.org" target="_blank">WinShape Camps</a> here in Athens/Watkinsville, GA. In November, I asked the girl of my dreams if she would marry me. She said yes, and now we're getting to plan a wedding together.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>During my free time, I like to stay active by running and playing sports like soccer and basketball. I enjoy using my EE background to build guitar amps and effect pedals, as well as Arduino and Rasberry Pi projects. Saturday mornings are spent watching College Gameday, the EPL, and designing cool things to make with technology.</p>

<h2>WinShape Camps</h2>
<p>One thing that I'm passionate about is helping local churches reach their communities, and one way that I've been a part of has been WinShape Camps. In 2009, I spent a summer teaching Wacky Science and that God is more than enough for each of them (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+12:9-10&version=ESV">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>). Five years later, I'm about to embark on my sixth summer of what has been one of the most life changing movements I've ever been a part of. I'm thankful for the opportunity to lead a team of 23 college students to equip churches to reach their communities.</p>
