<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I recently Graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I'm currently finishing up an internship with <a href="http://www.winshapecamps.org" target="_blank">WinShape Camps</a> here in Athens/Watkinsville, GA. In November, I asked the girl of my dreams if she would marry me. She said yes, and now we're getting to plan a wedding together.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>During my free time, I like to stay active by running and playing sports like soccer and basketball.</p>
