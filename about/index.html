<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I recently Graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I'm currently finishing up an internship with <a href="http://www.winshapecamps.org" target="_blank">WinShape Camps</a> here in Athens/Watkinsville, GA. In November, I asked the girl of my dreams if she would marry me. She said yes, and now we're getting to plan a wedding together.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>During my free time, I like to stay active by running and playing sports like soccer and basketball. I enjoy using my EE background to build guitar amps and pedals, as well as Arduino and Rasberry Pi projects. Saturday mornings are spent watching College Gameday, the EPL, and designing cool things to make with technology.</p>
