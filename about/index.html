<h2>Born and raised in Chicago, I grew up with a love for creating things.</h2>

<p>Before designing, I studied film at Columbia College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. I was a video editor for many years before discovering <a href='http://www.8thlight.com/' target="_blank">8th Light</a>.</p>

<p>I studied design under <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/stephanie-briones" target="_blank">Stephanie Briones</a>, where I learned to keep things simple. I believe that good design should not only be beautiful but also easy to use.</p>

<p>When I'm not designing you will find me running, playing video games, and going out to dinner with my friends.</p>
